/**
 * Initialization input
 * Line 1: the number surfaceN of points used to draw the surface of Mars.
 * Next surfaceN lines: a couple of integers landX landY providing the coordinates of a ground point. By linking all the points together in a sequential fashion, you form the surface of Mars which is composed of several segments. For the first point, landX = 0 and for the last point, landX = 6999
 * 
 * Input for one game turn
 * A single line with 7 integers: X Y hSpeed vSpeed fuel rotate power
 * X,Y are the coordinates of Mars Lander (in meters).
 * hSpeed and vSpeed are the horizontal and vertical speed of Mars Lander (in m/s). These can be negative depending on the direction of Mars Lander.
 * fuel is the remaining quantity of fuel in liters. When there is no more fuel, the power of thrusters falls to zero.
 * rotate is the angle of rotation of Mars Lander expressed in degrees.
 * power is the thrust power of the landing ship.
 * 
 * Output for one game turn
 * A single line with 2 integers: rotate power :
 * rotate is the desired rotation angle for Mars Lander. Please note that for each turn the actual value of the angle is limited to the value of the previous turn +/- 15Â°.
 * power is the desired thrust power. 0 = off. 4 = maximum power. Please note that for each turn the value of the actual power is limited to the value of the previous turn +/- 1.
